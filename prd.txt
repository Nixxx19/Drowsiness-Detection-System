Project: Driver Drowsiness Detection System

🏁 1. Overview
The Driver Drowsiness Detection System aims to enhance road safety by identifying signs of fatigue in drivers through real-time video analysis. The system uses a webcam (or in-vehicle camera) to monitor the driver’s facial landmarks, detecting eye blinks, prolonged eye closure, and yawning as indicators of drowsiness. When detected, the system triggers visual and/or auditory alerts to wake the driver.

🎯 2. Objectives
Primary Goal:
Reduce road accidents caused by driver fatigue through real-time detection and alert mechanisms.
Secondary Goals:
Implement a lightweight, camera-based detection system without requiring external sensors.
Maintain high accuracy across lighting and face-angle variations.
Operate in real-time (≥ 10 FPS).
