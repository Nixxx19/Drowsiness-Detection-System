Project: Driver Drowsiness Detection System

🏁 1. Overview
The Driver Drowsiness Detection System aims to enhance road safety by identifying signs of fatigue in drivers through real-time video analysis. The system uses a webcam (or in-vehicle camera) to monitor the driver’s facial landmarks, detecting eye blinks, prolonged eye closure, and yawning as indicators of drowsiness. When detected, the system triggers visual and/or auditory alerts to wake the driver.
