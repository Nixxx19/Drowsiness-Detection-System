Project: Driver Drowsiness Detection System

üèÅ 1. Overview
The Driver Drowsiness Detection System aims to enhance road safety by identifying signs of fatigue in drivers through real-time video analysis. The system uses a webcam (or in-vehicle camera) to monitor the driver‚Äôs facial landmarks, detecting eye blinks, prolonged eye closure, and yawning as indicators of drowsiness. When detected, the system triggers visual and/or auditory alerts to wake the driver.

üéØ 2. Objectives
Primary Goal:
Reduce road accidents caused by driver fatigue through real-time detection and alert mechanisms.
Secondary Goals:
Implement a lightweight, camera-based detection system without requiring external sensors.
Maintain high accuracy across lighting and face-angle variations.
Operate in real-time (‚â• 10 FPS).

üë• 3. Target Users
User Type	Description	Needs
Individual Drivers	Car and truck drivers who drive for long durations	Need an alert when drowsiness occurs
Fleet Companies	Organizations managing multiple vehicles	Require monitoring to prevent fatigue-related accidents
Automobile OEMs	Manufacturers seeking safety feature integrations	Want embedded ML solution for smart vehicles

üîç 4. Problem Statement
Drowsy driving causes thousands of accidents annually. Manual monitoring is impractical, and existing commercial systems are expensive. There is a need for a low-cost, camera-based ML system capable of detecting early signs of drowsiness in real time.
